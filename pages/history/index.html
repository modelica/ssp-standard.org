            <p>To continue the development of model exchange beyond the
                component level of FMI, the SSP core development partners
                decided to create a home for their activities under the roof of
                the Modelica Association. According to the Bylaws
                of the Modelica Association, a new
                <a href="https://modelica.org/projects">Modelica Association Project</a>
                “System Structure and Parameterization of Components for 
                Virtual System Design” (abbreviated as SSP) was created.</p>

            <p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>

            <p>In many applications there is the need to design, simulate and
                execute a network of components (simulation models, software,
                hardware etc.). In order to be able to do this tool 
                independently and seamlessly, the purposes of this project are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Define a standardized way to store and apply parameters
                    to these components.</li>
                <li>Define a standardized format for the connection
                    structure for a network of components.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The developed standard / APIs should be usable in all stages of
                development process (architecture definition, integration,
                simulation, test in MiL, SiL, HiL).</p>
            <p>The work in this project shall be coordinated with other
                standards and organizations (FMI, ASAM, OMG).</p>
