## Modelica Association Project

To continue the development of model exchange beyond the component level of FMI, the SSP core development partners decided to create a home for their activities under the roof of the Modelica Association. According to the Bylaws of the Modelica Association, a new Modelica Association Project “System Structure and Parameterization of Components for Virtual System Design” (abbreviated as SSP) was created.

## Purpose

In many applications there is the need to design, simulate and execute a network of components (simulation models, software, hardware etc.). In order to be able to do this tool independently and seamlessly, the purposes of this project are:

Define a standardized way to store and apply parameters to these components.
Define a standardized format for the connection structure for a network of components.
The developed standard / APIs should be usable in all stages of development process (architecture definition, integration, simulation, test in MiL, SiL, HiL).

The work in this project shall be coordinated with other standards and organizations (FMI, ASAM, OMG).
